DJANGOMODELPERMISSIONS 

- go to users & in “available user permissions” you can specify add/change/delete abilities for specific API users who are authorized with a token — e.g. you can have a user be able to POST (Add) but not to PUT(change) or DELETE(delete) but they need their token to do it 

    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication,]

    permission_classes = [DjangoModelPermissions,]

Find me (authenticate) & authorize me
401 - Forbidden
    - you’re not allowed to hit this endpoint and i don’t know who you are 

403 - Unauthorized — permissions issue 
    - i know who you are but you’re not allowed to do this 

^^^ this is having a user with an API token but not allowing them to view specific endpoints 
^^ do this by having these lines in the same viewset class  in this order … 
authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication,]
permission_classes = [IsAdminUser,]

- if i know you then you can read this endpoint but you need a token to POST/DELETE/etc…

    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication,]
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,]
